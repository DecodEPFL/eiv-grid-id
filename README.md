Distribution network identification via error-in-variable models.

## Getting started
This project relies on Python via the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution.
To get started, first download anaconda. 

Then, in the root folder of the repository, run:
``` shell script
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
It will create a virtual environment with all the required packages.

Then, you are ready to check out the notebooks. To do so, run:
``` shell script
jupyter lab
```
and navigate to the `notebooks` folder.
